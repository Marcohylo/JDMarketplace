**Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.**
JDM or (Japanese Domestic Market) refers to vehicles from Japan's home market, and is generally accepted as the vehicles and parts that were designed under Japanese regulations for Japanese buyers. Since the 90's, the worldwide popularity has grown for JDMs, and many car enthusiasts seek to either buy or sell their precious japanese cars. 

**Why is it a problem that needs solving?**
Despite the worldwide popularity in JDMs, there are still no well known dedicated two sided marketplace for them. This is why my marketplace is designed to solve this problem, and to allow car enthusiasts to browse, buy and list their own JDMS for sale.
